# HTTPLeaks

## What is this?

This project aims to enumerate all possible ways, a website can leak HTTP requests. 
In one single HTML file. See the file `leak.html` in the root of this repository.

## What for is it?

You can use this to test your browser for CSP leaks, your web-mailer for HTTP leaks and everything else that is not supposed to send HTTP requests to where the sun won't shine.

## And now?

The HTML will be extended, pull requests with additional exotic sources for HTTP leaks are very welcome!
