# HTTPLeaks

This project aims to enumerate all possible ways, a website can leak HTTP requests. In one single HTML file.

You can use this to test your browser for CSP leaks, your web-mailer for HTTP leaks and everything else that is not supposed to send HTTP requests to where the sun won't shine.

The HTML will be extended, pull requests with additional exotic sources for HTTP leaks are very welcome!
